            <p id="excu_summary">The main topic that our group will address in this project is migration, with thorough
                research and
                careful search for relevant data on the topic through a <strong>Table of Contents</strong> to show the
                information and
                prove the reason why our team chose the topic above.<br><br>
                To provide readers with a more comprehensive understanding of migration, we have depicted this through
                <strong> the Migration Data in Australia map</strong> below
                When users hover over states, a box contains information such as state names and migrant groups as well
                as the total number of migrants our team studied. Additionally, with dots containing the names of cities
                in the state, our team has also developed a similar feature to display state information. Furthermore,
                when the user clicks on the <strong>dots</strong>, a line graph for each city appears, illustrating the
                number of
                migrants for each group as mentioned above. Along with the appearance of the chart is the appearance of
                a bar chart providing information about the migration age milestones of each group of migrants, showing
                which age groups and types of migrants tend to migrate to Australia the most. To further prove our
                chosen point, our team conducted an analysis of one state, <strong>New
                    South
                    Wales</strong>, which has the highest number of migrants. Presented before the user is a detailed
                map of the state's territory, with dots representing several major cities, and hovering over them
                displays the city names. And right below is a stacked column chart of 3 object names for 2 areas
                considered the most developed in the state. Information and data will be displayed when the user hovers
                over the column.<br><br>
                In summary, regarding our website, we aim for users to have a fresh and comprehensive understanding of
                the migration topic, using Australia as an example. Our group has also provided various datasets to
                somewhat convey to users the general topic and the specific issue of migration to Australia.

                    Our team has developed a map of Australia depicting its states and within each state we have
                    outstanding development area. This is intended to make users aware of the differences between states
                    based on migration flows, thereby providing users with additional insights into why some
                    states attract more migrants in the three designated groups.
                    Putting age demographics into this context doesn't just illustrate the downward trend
                    migrate to Australia at any age, as mentioned earlier, but also to provide readers with a
                    more diverse perspectives on information related to migrants from other countries to Australia.
