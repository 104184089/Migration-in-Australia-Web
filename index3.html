        <h3> Explain</h3>
        <p>
            In showcasing the migration numbers for the three target groups across the states of Australia, our team has
            identified New South Wales as having the highest volume. Therefore, on this page, we have chosen to display
            New South Wales prominently to help users better understand this fact. Within the Greater Sydney region,
            notable cities include Sydney, Parramatta, and Central Coast. Transitioning to the rest of New South Wales,
            cities such as Newcastle, Wollongong, Tweed Heads, Maitland, Wagga Wagga, Albury, Coffs Harbour, Tamworth
            stand out. These cities are represented by red dots, symbolizing major urban centers within the state, with
            hover-over functionality to display city names. Furthermore, a line chart is provided to clearly illustrate
            the disparity in migration numbers between the two regions in a concise and coherent manner."
